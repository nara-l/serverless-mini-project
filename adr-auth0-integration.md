# Architecture Decision Record: Auth0 Integration for Serverless Lab

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our serverless lab application requires a secure and scalable authentication and authorization solution. We need to ensure that only authenticated users can access our API endpoints and that we can easily manage user identities and access controls.

## Decision
We have decided to integrate Auth0 as our identity provider and use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication and authorization in our serverless application.

## Rationale
- Auth0 provides a robust, cloud-based identity management solution that can easily scale with our application.
- It offers support for various identity providers and social logins, giving our users flexibility in how they authenticate.
- JWT-based authentication is stateless and works well with serverless architectures.
- Auth0 integrates well with our existing AWS services, particularly API Gateway and Lambda.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Improved security with industry-standard authentication practices.
- Reduced development time for implementing complex auth features.
- Flexibility to add new authentication methods in the future.
- Offloading of user management to a specialized service.

### Negative
- Introduction of an external dependency (Auth0 service).
- Potential cost implications based on Auth0 pricing tiers.
- Need for team members to familiarize themselves with Auth0 concepts and management.

## Implementation Details
1. Set up an Auth0 tenant for our application.
2. Configure API Gateway to use a custom authorizer that validates Auth0-issued JWTs.
3. Update Lambda functions to extract user information from validated JWT claims.
4. Implement proper error handling for authentication failures.
5. Document the authentication flow for developers and operations team.

## Related Decisions
- Decision to use AWS API Gateway and Lambda for our serverless architecture.
- Future decision needed on implementing fine-grained authorization based on user roles.

## Notes
- Regular review of Auth0 security best practices and updates will be necessary.
- Consider implementing monitoring and alerting for authentication-related events.
